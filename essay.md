To whom it may concern:

As I reflect on what I have accomplished, I realize that my greatest successes come from when I am able to build relationships to benefit my professional environment. I enjoy acting as a collaborator and sharing information between projects. I have been able to leverage and develop this ability within my current position as a risk manager at Fannie Mae. 
As a risk manager within a Program Management Office (PMO), I have helped develop a uniform risk process across 18 projects at differing levels of maturity. To develop this process, we reached out to each project to introduce ourselves and communicate our objective. We worked with established projects to build the risk process, as well as, offered training and system administrative support to developing teams. This early exposure to teams, helped me develop relationships and build a working foundation. 
I continue to work regularly with project managers through the implementation and maintenance of the PMO risk process. This opportunity to work closely with each team has allowed me to get a detailed view of uncertainties and analyze the potential impacts. I support the development of linkages between dependent projects and help the flow of cross project collaboration. I connect the dots across the program and apply my experiences with risk management and build a holistic view of the program. Similar to a magic eye painting, sometimes you have to first see the details up close before you can take a step back and see the big picture.
I have been fortunate to be in a role that compliments my existing skill set, but I am now anticipating the next step forward. If enrolled at Georgetown Universityâ€™s Evening MBA program, I would be able to utilize the vast academic resources and new professional connections to build my tool set of skills and reach my goals. My short term goal is to improve risk and project management processes within my role at Fannie Mae. A more intimate class size, as offered by the Evening MBA program, provides more opportunity to develop close relationships with my peers and professors. Exposure to different industries and management styles would allow me to study real examples of how other professionals have addressed similar efforts. 
A longer term goal of mine is to further develop my critical thinking and analytical skills. Within my current role, I look at actions, decisions and uncertainties across projects to identify common trends. These trends depict a picture of what risks exist at a higher level and require senior management involvement. Through development of critical thinking abilities, I will be able to identify trends, determine root cause and evaluate how to mitigate possible risks. I will also be able to more effectively assist project managers in developing response strategies and contingency plans. Critical thinking to me, is the ability to thoroughly evaluate multiple solutions and determine which resolution will have the highest benefit and the lowest negative impact. I look forward to honing this transferable skill through the Evening MBA Program. Specifically through Intensive Learning Experience, I look forward to the opportunity to put analytical skills to the test through a hands on case study.  This will be an experience I can utilize in my current and future roles.  
Through my time at Fannie Mae, I have learned who I am and what I have to offer. As an active student within this program, I would be able to provide my own point of view, experience and skills to the benefit of my fellow classmates. I offer a unique perspective of the inter-workings of a Program Management Office within a dynamic firm such as Fannie Mae. I can also share how to effectively build professional relationships and leveraging that bond to piece together something larger. With each class that comes through the Evening MBA Program, there is the opportunity to build a stronger program and network, I welcome the opportunity and strive to be a part of building something bigger than myself.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely, 

Emily Engelman
